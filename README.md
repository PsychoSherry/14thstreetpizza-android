Disclaimer
----------

This app was built in a few days and is still under construction. Please ignore bugs, both Code-wise and Appeareance-wise (especially ones you see while opening the app in a Tablet). Given sufficient time, I can complete this app beautifully and perfectly. THIS IS A GUARANTEE. I've left the Web-Communication code, because a Web API was not provided. But if it is, this app can easily be made functional with it (or I can design you a better Web-End).


App Compatibility
-----------------

As a coding practice, this app is built on the Android SDK 14 onwards. This means that *this app will only run on Android versions 4.0.0 (ICS) and higher*. Once the app is near completion, an android compatibility library can be added to make it work on older devices as well.

Also, this app supports **Facebook & Twitter Authentication** - but has been disabled for testing purposes. For a working model, please contact me.
