So, What's Different in my App?
-------------------------------

### Authentication

Well, for starters, I used only **Facebook (and/or Twitter) Authentication**. Why, you ask? The reason is simple. Instead of forcing users to sign up (which they may do with fake or crap information), all they need to do is simply signup/login via their Facebook Accounts. This is more **User-Friendly** and has a greater chance of getting the user's correct information. Also, disabling accounts can be as easy as blocking their FacebookIDs.

### Google Maps API

Although it still requires some debugging, I tried to incorporate Google Maps API. This has a great advantage. **The user can simply mark the place on the map where he wants his ordered delivered.** He'll still have to enter his address, for the sake of the deliveryman, but by pinning his delivery location, this would really help out the delivery guy in reaching the address quickly without asking for too many directions.

### Agile Code

The code is written in a very understandable and modular way and has been optimized to the fullest extent. All references and resources are properly labeled. **REST API** libraries have already been set up in the app. This allows us to integrate the app with your Backend (or any other for that matter) very easily. 


Disclaimer
----------

This app was built in a few days and is still under construction. Please ignore bugs, both Code-wise and Appeareance-wise (especially ones you see while opening the app in a Tablet). Given sufficient time, I can complete this app beautifully and perfectly. I've left the Web-Communication code, because a Web API was not provided. But if it is, this app can easily be made functional with it (or I can design you a better Web-End).


App Compatibility
-----------------

As a coding practice, this app is built on the Android SDK 14 onwards. This means that **this app will only run on Android versions 4.0.0 (ICS) and higher**. Once the app is near completion, an android compatibility library can be added to make it work on older devices as well.

Also, this app supports **Twitter Authentication** as well - but has been disabled for testing purposes. For a working model, please contact me.


Known Issues/Bugs
-----------------

1. After completing your order once, if you try to order again without restarting the app, it crashes.
2. If you start the app, and while using it you disable the GPS, the app crashes.
3. Sometimes on slow internet connections, User DP will not be loaded due to the Facebook API Timeout.
